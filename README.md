# DukeCON Interpreter
DukeCON is a strict subset of the CON scripting language used to modify Duke Nukem 3D, the 1996 FPS.
DukeCON's purpose is to assist users with understanding how the CON language works.
The interpreter can be used as a tool for users to see how the language really works.
This interpreter was written with guidance from Thorsten Ball's book [`Writing An Interpreter In Go`](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## Building the Interpreter
```bash
make build
```

## Running tests
```bash
make tests
```
